## Project
### Introduction
This first practical session was focused on the numerical study and CFD simulation of the injector of the combustion chamber of the next SNECFRAN engine. In order to do so, a numerical model of the combustion chamber and its associated mesh was given, as well as the desired model parameters (speeds, turbulence, temperature…etc). The main goal of this simulation will be to identify stationary behaviors of the flame, depending on the topology, geometry and model parameters that are chosen. We will therefore be able to use the C-equation model for premixed combustion in order to analyze the topology of a premixed turbulent methane flame as a function of the inlet swirl number. We will then study the effect of stretch on the stability of the flame and consider possible improvements for this CFD model and simulation.
