## Project
### Introduction
The initial practical session was devoted to conducting a numerical investigation and using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to simulate the injector of the combustion chamber of the next-generation SNECFRAN engine. The session began by providing participants with a numerical model of the combustion chamber and its corresponding mesh, as well as the model parameters such as velocities, turbulence levels, and temperatures. The primary objective of this simulation was to detect the stationary characteristics of the flame, based on the topology, geometry, and model parameters selected. To achieve this, the C-equation model for premixed combustion was employed to evaluate the topology of a turbulent methane flame as a function of the inlet swirl number. Furthermore, we examined the impact of stretch on the flame's stability and considered potential improvements for the CFD model and simulation.
